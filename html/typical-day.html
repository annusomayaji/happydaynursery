            <h3>Typical Day</h3>
            <p>A typical day in Happy Day Nursery consists of a range of activities that children can enjoy through the day. We make sure children are having lots of fun while also learning.</p>
            <p><strong>Breakfast</strong></p>
            <p>Breakfast is a social occasion and starts from 7:30am as children start to arrive to nursery. there is a wide range of cereals, fresh fruits and toast available.</p>
            <p><strong>Morning activities</strong></p>
            <p>Children have access to free play after breakfast.Children choose an activity of their interest and play is child lead. Activities are carefully planned to include aspects of EYFS ranging from messy play to music making.It is followed by more structured activity , circle time. Children learn about each other, their surrounding and more. </p>
            <p><strong>Circle time</strong></p>
            <p>Breakfast is a social occasion and starts from 7:30am as children start to arrive to nursery. there is a wide range of cereals, fresh fruits and toast available.</p>
            <p><strong>Lunch</strong></p>
            <p>Homemade lunch is served at 11:30 for children to enjoy and even staff join in to make this a enjoyable experience.Lunch is balanced keeping healthy diet in mind. </p>
            <p><strong>Quiet time</strong></p>
            <p>Children enjoy quiet time after a busy morning with activities such as story time, puzzles or even a little lie down to get a much important rest.</p>
            <p><strong>Afternoon activities</strong></p>
            <p>Afternoon activities are a mixture of child led play and structured activities. ACivities are always designed so children can enjoy and learn no matter what age they are. </p>
           <p><strong>Home time</strong></p>
            <p>At the end of the day parents can get a report of what their child has been doing during the day. We believe it is important to keep good communication with all parents so it can have a positive impact on the child's development</p>
